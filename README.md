Welcome to the Bartch Trees Website!
For those that don't know, this is not a real band website. Instead, this is the Croom's Academy Submission for the 2019 TSA Webmaster Competition. We have put a lot of effort into the creation of this website, and truly hope that you enjoy it. We have actually learned a lot throughout this competition.

What did we Learn?
Learning React
Working as a Team
Working within the TSA Rules
Why did we chose React.js?
This is a question that we got asked frequently from our peers while we were building our website. React is a Javascript Framework created by the Facebook Open Source Team that makes it painless to create painless user interfaces. When we were deciding on a tech stack for our website, we debated a few different options. The first was Bootstrap, then Material, and of course React. We eventually chose React, because of its huge community and support.
